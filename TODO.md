#### NEW: Sync switch state when changed in Homemmatc WebUI
A solution is implemented where Domoticz is triggering requesting the state from the CCU.
This is done during the check interval to update meter (energy) data.
Seeking for a solution where the CCU triggers the update of the Domoticz device.
